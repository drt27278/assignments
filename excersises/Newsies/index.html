    <p><strong>GOTHAM CITY</strong>, The Joker is behind bars this morning! The JOker was apprehended early this morning by none other than "The Batman". After about three and a half hours of 
    high speed chases and gunfire The Joker was taken into custody by Batman, beaten and with injuries over the majority of his body he was handed over to Commissioner Gordon who then personally trasnported 
    The Joker to the secure medical wing at the infamous Arkham Asylum. The Joker has had many many previous stays at the state hospital and somehow managed to escape every incarceration in the facility. Some 
    have even begun to question whether The Batman has been in cahoots witnh the criminal mastermind. As always batman was not available for questioning, Comm. Gordon's response when asked the question was: 
    "I like my rib cage in one piece, ask him yourself." We were unable to get an interview with any members of the GCPD or with the staff  at Arkham. The citizens of Gotham are in an uproar, we demand to know if this will 
    finally be the last straw for the Joker, will he be put away for good this time or is this just the same record we've been dealing with for the past two decades! When will they decide that he needs to be sentenced to the death penalty 
    and put in the rearview mirror for good! Gotham has put up with crime and punishment for way too long, it's time for a change...a major change. someone give that weirdo in the red cape to come solve the problem Batman clearly can't 
    get the job done with his "no killing" rule, Superman almost killed off an entire city over night...thats what we need! We need to spark a changeit's not going to happen on it's own. If Batman doesn's figure things out soon with the GCPD then 
    this city will more than likely see it's downfall within the next 3-5 years, and I won't be around to witness that, I've seen way too much destruction and lost too many family members to the "preservation" of this city. What is there to preserve? I can't think of anything 
    other than the Bruce Wayne Orphan Foundation, there really isn't a whole lot worth saving. This needs to end, the crime, the fear, the pain and the horror we all 
    face every single day. <mark>#cleanupgotham</mark>
