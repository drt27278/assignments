    <p>We have been a family run busines since 1963! That's a long time! Our dedication is to bring you the very best quality, classic horror films that we possibly can. Fron "Nosferatu" to "28 Days Later" we promise to bring the frights and make you feel as though you are watching a movie in your own home among good friends. We do accept film requests within reason. We will do our very best to meet those requests to find the film and/or films you are looking for, that's a promise! The theater is also available for rent, for various activities. These include business gathering/parties, birthdays, Halloween Monster Mash (special theater only event). For information please select'Contact Us'. We are so grateful for your service and dedication over the decades! Stay scared! </p>
