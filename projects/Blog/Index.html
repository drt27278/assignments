    <p><div1>Release Date: October 5, 2018</div1> Following last weeks CinemaCon we got our first glimpse at Venoms Symbiote. When the teaser trailer was released rumors began to spread that the actual Venom would only make
        a very limited appearance in the upcoming film. With the new trailers release that is looking like just what it was..a rumor. Tom Hardy stars in the comic book adaptation of Marvel's Venom series, we have no news on a rating 
        or when/if we will get to see another trailer in the coming months. So far from what we have seen, this film is going to stray from the humor and light heartedness of previous Marvel films. At this point there really isn't a whole 
        lot of information which comes as no surprise being a comic boo movie it's a given that it will be shrouded in mystery and kept under wraps for the next few months. Watch the trailer here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Mv98Gr5pY">Venom Trailer #2</a> (Published May 1, 2018)

    <h3>DEADPOOL 2</h3>

    <img src = "https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/deadpool-2.jpg?quality=98&strip=all&w=782" class = "center">

    <p2><div>Release Date: May 18, 2018</div> If the sequel is anything like the first one than Deadpool 2 will have no problems in the box office. The first film was an instant hit with fans and non fans alike. Ryan Reynolds
    returns as the potty mouthed wise ass Wade Wilson whose alter ego is no less vulgar than his disfigured normal self. Having not been a huge Marvel fan to begin with, I went into the first film with little to no expectations
    on how the outome of the film would be. But believe me I left the theater with sore abs and a rawthroat from laughing almost beginning to end! i literally have nothing bad to say about the original and am so excited to see
what mischief Mr. Wilson gets himself into in the sequel. View the trailer here: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20bpjtCbCz0">Deadpool 2 final trailer</a> (Published May 1, 2018)</p2>
