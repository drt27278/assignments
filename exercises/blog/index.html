    <h3 class = 'hereditary'>Hereditary Review (8/16/2018)</h3>

    <P>Notably one of the Best horror films to be released this year! Terrifying, visceral and the very definition of disturbing, are just a few ways to describe "Hereditary". This film had me hooked from the very begining, it's dark tone coupled with the felling of dread and anxiety made this film very near perfect in my opinion. Now with that said, it didn't come without flaws. At times the film dragged on, it was definitely a slow burn but once you get to the final climax it all adds up and makes all the waiting well worth the wait!</P>

    <h3 class = 'slenderman'> Slender Man Review (8/2/2018)</h3>

    <p>Let me start off by saying, avoid this film at all costs. Very poor writing, horrible acting, hardly any "Slender Man" footage. Just your basic PG-13 Hollywood "cookie cutter" horror film. I don't say this very often if at all but I hated evry second of this film, so boring, anti climatic, stupid effects and just flat out not scary. But i you are into Teen Bopper back to 2000 horror films. this is for you. otherwise don't even wait for Red Box just skip this one entirely. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</p>

    <h3 class = 'revenge'>REVENGE Review (8/1/2018)</h3>

    <p>Reveng was an enourmous breath of resh air for horror fans. It had the look and feel of 2011's "Drive" as well as the origina revenge film "I Spit on Your Grave". I love this film through and through. Incredible synth soundtrack, great performance by all the actors involved and most of all the Retro 80's feel to the whole movie. The over the top violence and anxiety was enough to drive viewers crazy but make them love the film even more! Having a female Protagonist made this film more believable and fun to watch. the only downfall was that it seemed like every characte had at least 10 gallons of blood in their bodies hahaha other than that it was an incredible! Must see!!!</p>
