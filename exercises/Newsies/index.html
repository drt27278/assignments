            <strong>SALT LAKE CITY-</strong>City Police were called to the downtown area sSaturday evening when a homeless man repoted
            sighting a "huge lizard" squirming out of a broken manhole. Upon further investigation the SLCPD did indeed find
            a "huge lizard" that actually turned out to be a 30 foot alligator that had made it's way into the Liberty Park
            area. Animal control services were contacted immediatelyto come help in the apprehension and retrieval of the
            monstrous reptile! It took nearly five and a half hours to tranquilize and contain the animal, with multiple
            injuries reported to both SLCPD officers and animal control officers alike. This is a story straigt out of science fiction and one for the books! how the city is going to handle this ongoing problem is a mystery not onlt us here at the Gazette but the public as well. If spot anymore of these dinosours roaming in your hood please call the local authorites IMMEDIATELY! We cannot stress that enough</p>

        <p class="para2"> One officer had his left arm severed and eaten by the animal (names will not be released at this time) This completely
            proves the legend of alliators in the sewers! Not only in New York City, where the legend began but all across
            the country! What could be causing these creatures to migrate to the sewer tunnels, is it food? Shelter? encroachment
            on territory? All of the above, or something a lot more sinister?! Will we ever know? who can tell?! The next
            time that you step on a manhole cover or are near a storm drain, remember that there could be something lurking
            in the darkness below and always be careful and mindful of storm drains and/or outflows!</p>
