    <p><strong>SALT LAKE CITY-</strong>City Police were called to the downtown area sSaturday evening when a homeless man repoted sighting a "huge lizard" squirming out of a broken manhole.
    Upon further investigation the SLCPD did indeed find a "huge lizard" that actually turned out to be a 30 foot alligator that had made it's way into the Liberty Park area. Animal control services were contacted immediately
to come help in the apprehension and retrieval of the monstrous reptile! It took nearly five and a half hours to tranquilize and contain the animal, with multiple
injuries reported to both SLCPD officers adn animal control officers alike. </p>
